# Covid19
MySQL file
Link to dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
Note: Data in the link above was been split into two tables later named Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations to compare the different results. However, all data used can be found in the data set outlined above.
This SQL file looks for to clean and validify the data being used. Then I seek to explore questions such as when Covid cases were the highest for each country, the number of covid cases at the height of the pandemic in the US, and much more.
